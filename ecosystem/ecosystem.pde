 * Ecosystem simulation

 * Step 1:

 * Develop a set of rules for simulating the real-world behavior of a creature,
 * such as a nervous fly, swimming fish, hopping bunny, slithering snake, etc.
 * Can you control the objectâ€™s motion by only manipulating the acceleration?
 * Try to give the creature a personality through its behavior (rather than
 * through its visual design).
